## What is Reticle?

Reticle is a **macOS-native screenshot tool** that brings the full power of [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) — the gold standard on Windows — to macOS.

Most macOS screenshot tools are either too simple (built-in Screenshot.app) or too expensive (CleanShot X at $29). Reticle is **completely free and open source**, with a ShareX-style annotation toolbar, workflow automation, and cloud upload built in from day one.

> **Pricing:** Free for everyone. Yes, everyone. Well — *almost* everyone.  
> **기엽이는 유료입니다.** 기엽아, 이거 쓰려면 커피 한 잔 사와. ☕

### Reticle vs. ShareX

ShareX is the undisputed best screenshot tool — on Windows. Reticle aims for **feature parity on macOS**, built natively with SwiftUI + AppKit + ScreenCaptureKit rather than a port.

| | Reticle | ShareX (Windows) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Native macOS (SwiftUI / AppKit) | ✅ | — |
| Freeze-screen annotation overlay | ✅ | ✅ |
| Instant drag-or-click capture | ✅ | ✅ |
| Annotation toolbar (21 tools) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Workflow / after-capture pipeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cloud upload destinations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Screen recording | 🔜 | ✅ |
